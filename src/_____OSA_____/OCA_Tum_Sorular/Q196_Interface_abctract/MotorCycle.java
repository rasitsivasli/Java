196.	Given this segment of code:
        ArrayList<Cycle> myList = new ArrayList<>();//  Cycle bir data türü yani class ismi
        myList.add(new MotorCycle());// buradaki const. -- yani Cycle parenttir.. Cycle c = new MotorCycle() gibi
        Which two statements, if either were true, would make the code compile? (Choose two.)

        A.  MotorCycle is an interface that implements the Cycle class.
        B.	Cycle is an interface that is implemented by the MotorCycle class.
        C.	Cycle is an abstract superclass of MotorCycle.
        D.	Cycle and MotorCycle both extend the Transportation superclass.
        E.	Cycle and MotorCycle both implement the Transportation interface.
        F.	MotorCycle is a superclass of Cycle.
