/*
Main difference between RuntimeException and checked Exception is that
It is mandatory to provide try-catch or try finally block to handle checked Exception
and failure to do so will result in a compile-time error,
while in the case of RuntimeException this is not mandatory.
A)  Reading Card
    Checking Card
B)  compilation fails only at line n1
C)  compilation fails only at line n2
D)  compilation fails only at line n3
E)  compilation fails only at both line n2 and Line n3








compilation fails at line n2
